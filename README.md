# Backpacking_Solution

Inspired by the NP-Complete Traveling Salesman Problem.

<h3>Objective</h3>
User inputs the 3 character Airport code of all airports they wish to visit, including a start date for the journey and the average time spent overall in per location (eg. 4 days is the average time spent in each location, could vary). The program accesses live data from Skyscanner and finds the cheapest route for the user to take in such a way where all locations are visited with no repetition.
